Newton's method and gradient descent:

Gradient descent maximizes a function using knowledge of its derivative. 
Newton's method, a root finding algorithm, maximizes a function using knowledge of its second derivative. 
That can be faster when the second derivative is known and easy to compute (the Newton-Raphson algorithm is used in logistic regression). However, the analytic expression for the second derivative is often complicated or intractable, requiring a lot of computation. Numerical methods for computing the second derivative also require a lot of computation
-- if N values are required to compute the first derivative, N2 are required for the second derivative.

L1:sparse output, bulid-in feature selection,laplace distribution.
L2:no parse output and bulid-in feature selection, but improve overfitting,Gaussian distribution.

freature scaling
reference:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling
1.rescaling(min-max):subject to new adding data(may become the smallest or biggest one)
2.mean normalization
3.standardization(z-score):subject to spare data()
4.scaling to unit length: good for applaing L1 norm
